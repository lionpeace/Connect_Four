# Connect_Four

My final project in the Computer Programming â…  course was to make one of the Connect Four or Solitaire games to be played on a terminal. 

In order to do and present one of these projects, I had to get a CC or above in my final exam, but I passed the course with a DC.

Therefore, I could not present my project to my professors. 

So I decided to write the Connect Four project by learning new information that we didn't learn in class (we didn't cover pointers, dynamic memory management, etc.).

I plan to release this project in versions.

Maybe in the final version, I can design this game with a GUI and create an AI that will play the game with the player.

I'm open to all developer comments, I'm at the very beginning of this and this is my first GitHub project. Please write your comments.

I will explain all the versions I released in this project, but before that I want to explain the logic of the Connect Four game.

WIKIPEDIA SAYS:
  Connect Four is a two-player connection rack game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. 
  The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. 
  The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. Connect Four is a solved game. 
  The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
